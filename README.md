Run "sh run_MOG.sh" to replicate the simulation in our paper.


Due to a legal issue, I cannot upload all the running code for SIDDMs or UFOGen. But DiffusionGANs should be a promising direction for future GenAI models.

Currently, I am looking for jobs. Thus, I cannot maintain this repo well. Please try your best to use the code for research purposes.
